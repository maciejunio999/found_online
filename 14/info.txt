    Given two numbers arr1 and arr2 in base -2, return the result of adding them together.
    Each number is given in array format:  as an array of 0s and 1s, from most significant bit to least
    significant bit.  For example, arr = [1,1,0,1] represents the number (-2)^3 + (-2)^2 + (-2)^0 = -3.
    A number arr in array, format is also guaranteed to have no leading zeros: either arr == [0] or
    arr[0] == 1.
    Return the result of adding arr1 and arr2 in the same format: as an array of 0s and 1s with no leading
    zeros.

    Input: arr1 = [1,1,1,1,1], arr2 = [1,0,1]
    Output: [1,0,0,0,0]
    Explanation: arr1 represents 11, arr2 represents 5, the output represents 16.

2.
    Given three integers x, y, and bound, return a list of all the powerful integers that have a value
    less than or equal to bound.
    An integer is powerful if it can be represented as xi + yj for some integers i >= 0 and j >= 0.
    You may return the answer in any order. In your answer, each value should occur at most once.

    Input: x = 2, y = 3, bound = 10
    Output: [2,3,4,5,7,9,10]
    Explanation:
        2 = 2^0 + 3^0
        3 = 2^1 + 3^0
        4 = 2^0 + 3^1
        5 = 2^1 + 3^1
        7 = 2^2 + 3^1
        9 = 2^3 + 3^0
        10 = 2^0 + 3^2
